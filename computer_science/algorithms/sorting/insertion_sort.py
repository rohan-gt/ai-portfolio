    """
    Sort an array in-place using the insertion sort algorithm.

    Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly
    taking elements from the unsorted portion and inserting them into their correct
    position in the sorted portion.

    Args:
        array (list[Any]): The input array to be sorted (modified in-place)

    Time Complexity:
        O(nÂ²) where n is the length of the array
        Best Case: O(n) when array is already sorted

    Space Complexity:
        O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of extra space
    """
    n = len(array)

    # Start from the second element (index 1)
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Move backwards through the sorted portion
        for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
            # If current element is greater than next element, swap them
